This Python script automates the process of backing up files from a local directory to a Google Drive folder. It utilizes the Google Drive API for seamless integration with Google Drive. The script checks for valid credentials, authenticates the user if necessary, and creates a dedicated folder (if not already existing) on Google Drive to store the backup files.

File Upload: Automatically uploads files from a specified local folder to the Google Drive folder.
Error Handling: Catches and prints any errors related to the Google Drive API.
Requirements:
Google Cloud project with Google Drive API enabled.
OAuth 2.0 credentials (Credentials.json).
